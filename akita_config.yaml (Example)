# akita_config.yaml - Example Configuration for Akita DDNS

# --- Core Settings ---

# Path for Reticulum storage (identities, transport data, etc.)
# Default: ~/.config/reticulum
storage_path: "~/.config/reticulum"

# IMPORTANT: The Identity hash defining THIS Akita DDNS network.
# All nodes participating in the *same* DDNS must use the *same* hash.
# Generate one using: python -c "import reticulum as ret; print(ret.Identity().hash.hex())"
# If left blank or commented out, an ephemeral one is generated (only for isolated testing).
akita_namespace_identity_hash: "GENERATE_AND_PASTE_YOUR_SHARED_AKITA_HASH_HERE" # <--- REPLACE THIS

# UDP Port for Akita service discovery and communication via Reticulum's AutoInterface.
# Ensure this port is open/forwarded if needed for nodes on different networks.
akita_port: 48000

# --- Timing Settings (seconds) ---

# Base interval for nodes to re-announce their registered names. Jitter is added automatically.
# A longer interval reduces network traffic but increases time for updates to be noticed if gossip fails.
update_interval: 3600 # 1 hour

# Default time-to-live for registrations if not specified by the client.
# How long a registration remains valid after its last update/registration.
default_ttl: 86400 # 1 day (24 * 60 * 60)

# Base interval for gossiping registry information. Jitter is added automatically.
# More frequent gossip propagates changes faster but increases traffic.
gossip_interval: 120 # 2 minutes

# How often the node checks its local registry for expired entries.
ttl_check_interval: 600 # 10 minutes

# How long resolved names stay in the local cache. Shorter TTL means more network lookups
# but faster reaction to changed RIDs.
cache_ttl: 300 # 5 minutes

# --- Performance & Limits ---

# Maximum number of entries in the resolution cache *per namespace*.
# Prevents the cache from growing indefinitely.
max_cache_size: 1000

# Max incoming requests per second (token bucket rate) before dropping packets.
# Helps prevent DoS amplification.
rate_limit_requests_per_sec: 10.0 # Can be float

# --- Logging ---

# Logging level: TRACE, DEBUG, VERBOSE, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# Corresponds to Reticulum log levels. Use INFO or NOTICE for normal operation.
log_level: "INFO"

# --- Persistence Settings ---

# Whether to save/load registry, namespaces, reputation to files.
# Set to false for ephemeral nodes or if manual state management is preferred.
persist_state: true

# Directory to store persistent state files (registry.yaml, etc.).
# Relative to execution directory or absolute path. Will be created if it doesn't exist.
persistence_path: "./akita_state"

# Filename for namespace owners persistence within persistence_path.
namespace_owners_file: "namespaces.yaml"

# Filename for registry persistence within persistence_path.
registry_file: "registry.yaml"

# Filename for reputation persistence within persistence_path.
reputation_file: "reputation.yaml"
