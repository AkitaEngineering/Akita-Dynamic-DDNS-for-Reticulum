# akita_ddns/__init__.py

# This file makes Python treat the directory 'akita_ddns' as a package.
# It can be empty or contain package-level initialization code if needed.

# You could potentially import key classes or functions here for easier access,
# e.g., from .main import main
# However, for this structure, keeping it empty is fine.
